        <h2 id="assignment-update">Assignment Update</h2>

<p>Hello again! I’ve managed to complete 1/3 assignments. There’s still 2 more to go, then I have one assignment due each week after that until mid July. Stressful! I can’t wait for this semester to be over. Every time the little voice in my head whispers “Drop out… drop out…” I remind myself that there is still value in having a Degree. It really just feels like I’m nudging a slow-walking turtle, urging it to move faster but its going nowhere. Let’s just get this over with!</p>

<h2 id="trying-godot">Trying Godot</h2>

<p>I’ve managed to try Godot out. I’m not familiar with GDScript, however I’ve managed to complete the tutorial at <a href="https://www.gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript/">https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript/</a>.
The language seems intuitive, so it might not be long before I’m a master at it! I’m very much used to C++ and object-oriented programming so it will take some time to adjust. I’m in no rush, getting the fundamentals nailed down is important to me.</p>

<p>I currently have 8 big game ideas/projects and 9 smaller ones written down. I’m not starved for ideas, that’s for sure. I just need the skills to execute these ideas properly. Of course, learning these skills will take some time.</p>

<p>I have to manage my time between studies and game development so it will be on the back burner until after exams. Right now it’s just a matter of chipping away at tutorials and getting comfortable in the Godot editor.</p>

<p>I have a positive overall outlook on my upcoming journey. Being involved in game development communities are a big motivation. Seeing people passionate and dedicated to their projects make me want to work on mine.</p>

<h2 id="working-hard">Working hard</h2>

<p>I’m hard at work completing assignments and expanding my gamedev knowledge, one day at a time! Sometimes hard work doesn’t mean banging your head against the wall until something clicks. I find that leaving a problem to marinate, and coming back to it at a later time actually makes it easier to solve. I think it’s the change in perspective, looking at a problem from different angles inspire creative ways of solving it.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Boo assignments..</li>
  <li>Godot initial impression: two thumbs up!</li>
  <li>Working hard or hardly working?</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep safe, happy and healthy!
