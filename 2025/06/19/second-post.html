        <h2 id="blog-website-visual-overhaul">Blog website visual overhaul</h2>

<p>Hello again! I have been working meticulously on the blog website. I’ve dived fairly deeply into HTML, CSS and markdown. It was such an enjoyable experience. I was inspired to install Ruby and Jekyll on my PC in order to run the website locally to avoid deploying to github millions of times. I’ve actually purchased a book set in 2017 titled “Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery”. It consists of two books titled; “HTML &amp; CSS: Designing and Building Websites” and “JavaScript &amp; jQuery: Interactive Front-End Development”, authored by Jon Duckett. Funny thing is, I’ve never opened them, they sat in my bookshelf untouched for 8 years. I wonder what the term for “having the intention to learn something, enjoying the <em>idea</em> of learning something, but not actually putting the effort to learn it” is called.</p>

<p>I mean.. no doubt I enjoyed working on the blog website, using HTML and CSS, creating gradients, transforms etc. But actually <em>learning</em> how to do it through a book seemed less appealing. Maybe its because I enjoy learning dynamically instead of statically? I guess its similar to improv vs. learning a script. Anyway! I’m quite happy with how the site looks, its simple and functional. This small project, that I worked on for about 4 days, have inspired me to actually open the aforementioned books. So that’s a positive!</p>

<h2 id="school-work-and-stress">School work and stress</h2>

<p>Boy oh boy… I have 3 assignments due next week. And guess what? I’ve spent 4 days working on my blog website. Maybe I used the website as a form of procrastination against doing assignments? I’m fairly proficient in my school work, it’s just monotonous/tedious/boring. I think I enjoy work that excites me. Both the blog and my school work consists of programming, however I get satisfaction only from one (the blog). It might be because the blog comes from my own inner desire and school work is handed to me. I’d rather fulfill my own desire. Certainly, I desire to obtain a “Bachelors in Computer Science” but.. it’s moreso the certification and validation that I desire more than the forced learning.</p>

<p>There’s also another dimension to it, I’m not trying to toot my own horn but I learn better on my own. Lecturers and teachers teach too slowly for me, they are not engaging and I don’t feel encouraged by their teachings. Ofcourse, I’m using this very post to procrastinate those assignments. What is procrastination in response to? In this case, stress. I think assignments are stressful, and I’d rather work myself to the bone on anything else than sit through a boring assignment. I’d rather build a massive castle FREELY than to be FORCED to draw a simple stick man.</p>

<h2 id="future-plans">Future plans</h2>

<p>I’d like to get into game development. School work and exams are coming up. I wonder how to balance my school work and game development. It’s currently June, exams are in October/November, school work is ramping up. I don’t think I can survive (mentally and spiritually) if I focus solely on school. I want to integrate game development into my daily life, maybe like 2-4 hours every day just learning and exploring the space. I’ll certainly keep you posted in the blog with what I’m working on!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I’ve enjoyed my <em>belated</em> first web development experience.</li>
  <li>School sux, freedom forever!</li>
  <li>1 order of Game Development, to go!</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep safe, happy and healthy! 
Regards, Cicadacore @ Cicadaware.</p>
