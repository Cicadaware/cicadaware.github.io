        <h2 id="welcome-to-my-first-blog-post">Welcome to my first blog post!</h2>

<p>Oh my! I have taken on the task of writing development blog posts. What does this actually mean? Well, in my case, it means I want to keep a journal. 
I have many reason for doing this: accountability, progress tracking, sharing and just a place where I can share my inner world.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-this-blog-mostly-consist-of">What will this blog mostly consist of?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I’d like to describe myself as a “code jockey meets eccentric creative”. What this really means is that I’m a creative technut. Oh.. that doesn’t sound too descriptive either. Basically, I love coding and creating art (in many forms!).</li>
  <li>I would say that there are two main categories that I’m interested in: art and software. There isn’t much within these two categories that I’m NOT interested in. Gimme all that knowledge!</li>
  <li>Naturally, at the intersection of these two categories lies game development, which contains both art and software.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to expect?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Not much. My writing skills leave a lot to be desired. Sometimes I don’t even know whats going on in my own noggin’, let alone being able
to put that into words. You can expect my sentences to range from “Modern-day Shakespeare” to “Is that even english!?”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My current creative skills are just like my writing skills, so don’t expect much there either. However, I’m very dedicated to learning and developing creative skills.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scope">Scope?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I’m currently working towards obtaining a “Bachelors of Computer Science” in University. This is a monumental task for me. I’m not sure how much time I can spare making blog posts on here. I’d like it to be something I’d do consistently, maybe weekly? monthly? Who knows!?</li>
  <li>I’d say “Have no expectations of consistency nor quality.” This is very much a casual blog, I don’t even expect anyone to read this!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="about-me">About me?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Hey there! My pseudonym is ‘Cicadacore’, it’s a pleasure to meet you!</li>
  <li>I’m introverted and a little socially awkward (could you tell?). I’d like to put myself out there more and experience the world.</li>
  <li>At the time of writing I’m a 28 years old male. I wear glasses, I have a few tattoos, I love gaming, movies, music, art, ..and most things introverted people are into!</li>
  <li>I am very much a regular guy so there’s not much extraordinary to mention, I’ve been through great times and really bad times (unfortunately), but would not like for those things to define me.</li>
  <li>I believe that an important part of being a creative is sharing your work with others, I’d like to start doing that, but courageously sharing my work online is a bit too much for me at the moment, so I’d like to start small with a blog. I just want to take the things that are in my mind and leave it somewhere, a kind of “cathartic offloading”.</li>
  <li>I have an obsessive curiosity that absolutely NEEDS to be sated. The subject doesn’t matter, I need to know how it works.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I hope I’ve given you a small glimpse into who I am and why I am starting this blog.</li>
  <li>My head is still dizzy from thinking what to write for a first blog!</li>
  <li>Here’s to many more!</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep safe, happy and healthy! 
Regards, Cicadacore @ Cicadaware.</p>
